//! # picoplace-engine
//!
//! This crate contains the core deterministic placement and SVG visualization logic
//! for the PicoPlace hardware design tool. It takes a `Schematic` object as input
//! and produces a placed layout and a corresponding visual representation.
//!
//! This is the heart of the "deterministic core" in the PicoPlace architecture.
